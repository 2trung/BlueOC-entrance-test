# Task 1: String Length Frequency

Solution:

- Use map to store the length of strings in array, then count the frequency of these strings.
- If there is more than 1 maximum frequency (they are equal) then all strings corresponding to those frequencies will be selected.

# Task 2: Sum of Top Two Integers

Solution:

- I use 2 values ​​"max1" and "max2" to store the two largest numbers. This keeps the complexity to only O(n) because the function makes a single pass through the array.
